# XMRig-Auto-Build
>A user-friendly interactive script that builds the latest XMRig straight from source

## About 
XMRig-Auto-Build downloads compile dependencies, uses the build scripts directly from XMRig to install updated libraries, and then (optionally) cleans up all the source code and leaves behind a XMRig binary and config.json.

Easy as downloading a pre-compiled binary!

*note: compile dependencies are NOT uninstalled afterwards, hopefully they'll be used for more compiling!*

## Supported Linux Distributions üêß
* **Debian** (apt based: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS)
* **Arch** (pacman based: Manjaro)
* **Fedora** (DNF based)
* (any distro that uses the same package manager as those three)

## Bugs
* Fedora does not compile XMRig's OpenSSL version properly, so LibreSSL is installed instead
